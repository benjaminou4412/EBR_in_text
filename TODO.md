# Earthborne Rangers — Dev TODO

A living checklist. Roughly prioritized.


- Implement ConstantAbilities
- Implement attachment system
- Implement faceup/facedown cards
- Implement Caustic Mulcher
  - Attachment system
  - faceup/facedown cards
- Implement actual challenge card objects and challenge deck behaviors
- Implement at least two other Valley NPCs
- Implement Refresh abilites and weather
  - can ride on faceup/facedown card system
- Implement Locations and Travel, arrival setup
- Implement weather-flipping
- Implement at least one Gear + one non-response Moment + 1 attachment, and the Play action
  - Have the gear commit effort so we're forced to implement that system too (committing effort from in-play cards in CommitDecision, spending tokens/exhausting as needed)
- Implement actual challenge cards rather than the current RNG setup
- Implement missions, campaign log entries, clear entries, etc.
- Implement Day system and save/load/autosave
- Prevent challenge effect re‑trigger when a card moves into an already‑resolved area during the same test
- Implement ordering selection:
  -scouting/remember
  -challenge effects in the same zone
  -response abilities at the same timing point
- automatic keyword loading from JSON
- Implement...the entire rest of the game.
