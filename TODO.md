# Earthborne Rangers — Dev TODO

A living checklist. Roughly prioritized.



- Implement Locations and Travel
    -just front-side and travel procedures; no campaign log entries or arrival setup
    -Finish implementing travel-blocking abilities (Obstacle and Caustic Mulcher)

- Prevent challenge effect re‑trigger when a card moves into an already‑resolved area during the same test
- Implement ordering selection:
  -scouting/remember
  -challenge effects in the same zone
  -response abilities at the same timing point

- Arrival setup for locations



- Implement actual challenge card objects and challenge deck behaviors
- Implement at least two other Valley NPCs
- Implement Refresh abilites and single-sided weather
- Implement weather-flipping
- Implement faceup/facedown cards
- Implement at least one Gear + one non-response Moment + 1 attachment, and the Play action
  - Have the gear commit effort so we're forced to implement that system too (committing effort from in-play cards in CommitDecision, spending tokens/exhausting as needed)
- Implement missions, campaign log entries, clear entries, etc.
- Implement Day system and save/load/autosave

- automatic keyword loading from JSON
- Implement...the entire rest of the game.
