# Earthborne Rangers â€” Dev TODO

A living checklist. Roughly prioritized.


- Implement at least two other Valley NPCs
- Implement Ambush with listeners

- Implement actual challenge card objects and challenge deck behaviors

- Arrival setup for locations


- Implement Refresh abilites and single-sided weather
- Implement weather-flipping
- Implement faceup/facedown cards
- Implement at least one Gear + one non-response Moment + 1 attachment, and the Play action
  - Have the gear commit effort so we're forced to implement that system too (committing effort from in-play cards in CommitDecision, spending tokens/exhausting as needed)
- Implement missions, campaign log entries, clear entries, etc.
- Implement Day system and save/load/autosave
- Implement full Travel map
- automatic keyword loading from JSON
- Implement...the entire rest of the game.
